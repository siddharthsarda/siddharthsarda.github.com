My plan to work on SICP and the resources that I will be relying on.

{%- endmark %}

I have been meaning to work through SICP for a long time and as I mentioned in my previous post, I am finally working on it.
The plan right now is to work through it in clojure and if required later switch to scheme. I chose Clojure because the awesome [Chris Stucchio](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yummyfajitas) told me it would be a good choice.

The resources that I plan to use are:  

*  [MIT Lecture Videos](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)

*  The SICP Book(also available [online](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).)

I will also keep posting the code I write on my github as well as keep posting solutions in the form of blog posts.

I will keep updating this section as I go along.
