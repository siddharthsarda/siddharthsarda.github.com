Whats the importance of the INSTALLED_APPS setting in Django?

{%- endmark %}

While trying to build my first django module [django-abtest](https://github.com/siddharthsarda/django-abtest/) I was a little stumped by the importance of **INSTALLED_APPS** setting in django. I decided to dig in to the django source to see where is the setting used.

###templates
* In template/loaders/eggs.py It is used to load templates from the installed apps.
* In template/loaders/app_directories.py It is used to load templates from the directory under the "templates" folder of each of the installed apps.
* In template/base.py  If you want to have custom template tags in django, they should sit under the *templatetags* folder of your app. In template/base.py django loads all the custom tags defined in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.

###core
* In core/management/__init__.py If an app has some [custom commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-management-commands/) defined then they are included if and only if the app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS. Additionally, django also goes ahead and adds autocomplete for them.
* In core/management/commands/syncdb.py When python manage.py syncdb is run, tables are created for all apps defined in INSTALLED_APPS.
* In core/management/flush.py While flushing the database we import the management module in each of the INSTALLED_APPS to register dispatcher events

###db
* In db/models/loading.py Used by AppCache to cache all the installed apps and their models
* In db/models/options.py I couldnt quite figure out how and why INSTALLED_APPS is used here. Please let me know, if you know why.

Apart from this this settings is also used in a lot of contrib modules like - auth, gis etc. However since I just wanted to get a basic understanding of what this setting achieves, I will stop here.

Let me know if I missed something.
